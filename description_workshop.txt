Calamity Clicker is addon which adds new clickers where used calamity materials or dropped from calamity bosses. This addon also planned add more post-Moonlord content up to Shadowspec-tier

Roadmap:
Complete Draedon Arsenal clickers set
Add some forgotted clickers (like Old Duke's Clicker)
Clickers for other addons (Like Bereft Vassal's Clicker for Infernum Mode)
Donor Clickers?
Make Renames and Reworks of clickers?

Also mod has changes in clicker class and calamity
1. Now reducing the click amount for click effect recalculated: real click amount percent = 1 / (2 - actual click amount percent)
2. 'The Clicker' and 'Quintessence Clicker' moved into Endgame Stage. (He is OP) The Clicker now crafted with using Shadowspec Bars. Making Quintessence Clicker now allow only after defeating Exo Mechs and Calamitas
3. Galactica Singularity now uses Mice Fragments in craft
4. Any Lunar Pillar enemies now drops mice fragments (less chance when other fragments but drops by any this event enemies)
5. Gamer Crate now uses Purified Gel in craft (make accessory after Slime God)
6. Calamity's Starter Bag contain starter clicker (Tin or Copper)
